## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I have used tmdb movie dataset.


Question 1 :Does popularity have an effect on the revenue?

Question 2 :Most popular runtime among movies

Question 3 :On which range of years most films are released?\

Question 4 :Is profit and release year relatable?

Question 5 :Which movie made a huge profit?

Question 6 :Which movie invested a high budget?

Question 7 :Which cast featured in most movies?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

tmdb-movies.csv               - The file contains all the data that is necessary for the analysis

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code are,

1. Revenue sometimes increase with popularity

2. Most films are produced in run time between 80 to 120 min.

3. it is found that more number of films are screened within the range(2009-2015). We can observe that there happened to be a drastic rise in the films after 2005

4. It can be seen that profits increased with the release year. Movies released in recent years made good profit. From the graph, it can also be said, more number of people have become fond of movies as year growsby that the profit is evident.

5. Avatar made huge profit and The Warrior's way invested high budget.
